## 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

I was born and grow in Shanghai, China. I immigrated to the States five years ago, at my thirties. When I was in China, the ability of English is my advantage. After I moved here, it turns out to be a weakness. Therefore, I am looking for a real “solid” skill to fulfill myself, which is internationally accepted. 

Objectively speaking, I think programming is a lifetime skillset, even though programming is keeping updating and developing. Another reason is the programming industry is booming and software engineers are always in huge demands. I have been living in Seattle for five years, and can feel the vitality of this city in the Technology industry.

Personally speaking, I am interested in Ada Developers Academy since Ada opens a door to me. I admire Ada’s vision and contributions to our community. I am interested in programming since it is detail-orientated and with innovation, passion and enthusiasm. Engineers need basic rules to generate codes, and need creative thoughts at the meantime. I took accounting classes in Bellevue College for the bookkeeping certificate. The part I don’t like about accounting is that everything is following the regulation. As an accountant, no one can be creative.

During my working experience, I worked with engineering team in game companies. As a team player, I get well along with engineers. One point I want to mention is that all those engineers are male. Before the popularity of web and mobile games, engineers working on the big console games are proud of using C++, C# for coding, which are treated as high-end code language. While web games need Flash and AS3 to code. I met so many senior engineers not willing to make adjustments. Personally, I am working on the Ada jumpstart classes on the Github right now. I know different code languages such as C+, Java, Html, and Juby. Some languages can work together for the better results. We create code in a text editor, which is also a computer program. I need more time and a chance to working on the codes formally and I believe that I can do great in the near future.

## 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

**_First 2 years_** I will take a full time job as a junior soft-engineer. Tech companies such as Mircosoft, Google, Amazon, other companies such as Costco and Starbucks and small companies are all needs engineers for web developing and maintenance or any other jobs I can do. I prefer game company.

**_Second 3-4 years_** I am supposed to get promoted since during the past two years, I am keeping learning and practice coding. Therefore, the aim of the second two-year-period is to be a senior soft-engineer. For this period, I would look for chance to go back to the game developing company if I wasn’t. I would like to contribute more time and energy to game developing. At the meantime, I start to learn some other code language such as Unity.  

**_Last the 5th year_** I should working on developing the second game. It might be a VR game on the mobile platform, since I think VR has so much potential in the near future. My updating coding language Unity skill will support the game developing.

## 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

It is said that everyone has three sexes. Physiological gender, that is, the body of your appearance; self-identified sex, that is, what you think you are and the social-identified sex, that is, what others think you are. Only when these three sexes are the same, we can distinguish ourselves from male or female.

But how about those who are not, what does their life look like? When I read the Ada’s statements, it brings me the memories of my friend in shanghai, who is in the trouble. When you look at her for the first glance, you cannot tell her gender. She is in a dilemma since she has a female body, but she thinks she is a male. People here in the States are talking about the trans-gender students should or should not use the male or female bathroom, while people in China are still working on providing free lunch for students in poverty. You can imagine how hard the life she has. She never drinks outside since she doesn’t want to hear those yelling at the restroom. She walks in bow back position because she is afraid of showing her body shape. As her friend, I know she is a nice person and understand her situation. She is not the only one facing this situation. As we mention that the Earth is a village, various people interact more frequently than ever, which brings us an even diverse society. 

The social justice is one of the key elements for living in this diverse society. No matter who you are/were, what kind of appearance you have/had, and at what age, everyone is equal. The way we respect others is the way we respect ourselves. Regardless of sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, education, age, race, or religion. This is also the inclusivity addressed in the Ada’s statements. 
I would like to be a life-long learner and devote my rest of life in the software industry. I feel excited when I realize that Ada supports women to be professional software developers who contribute to changing the world with software. I would like to advocate my female friends to change, to know Ada.

## 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?


I would like to share a mistake in my life in 2012, when I was having my first kid. Like other new moms, I was worried and nerves at that time. When my mom and my mother-laws offered helps at the same time, I think it would be great if they could help me at the same time right after my delivery.

To some extent, the bad consequence is not unpredictable. Both moms insisted on her own ways such as how to give a baby bath and how often to feed the baby. They refused to negotiate and listen to each other. I had to send both back to her home as a result. 
What did I learn from this mistake? First, I should never put two leaders in the same team. In a team, even team members should cooperate and team-working. But we only need a leader to make the final decision. Both moms treat themselves as the leader, bringing no acceptable final decision. But is it possible to sign my mom and my mother-in-law as one is a leader and another one is a follower? I doubt. Therefore, the second, negotiation doesn’t always work. When people are not capable of thinking in a calm and objective way, we should give them more time and space. I think that even though we advocate that as a team member we should collaborate, but there are people who could never be on the same page. It would be smarter to put them in the different groups. Third, if a job can be completed by one person perfectly, it might be done by two people worse, since there is no ownership. What we should do is to enhance the morale and maximize the productivity. 

After both moms went back, I realized that I could take care of my baby all by myself. I joined a group of new moms, where we share experience and life puzzles. I can search information on the websites and read books for the ways of taking my baby. Now, both my kids are happy and health. Sometimes, we might be doubtful in our abilities about new affairs. We might be lost or upset at the beginning, but the difficulty might be easier then we thought. Here comes another conclusion: Give yourself a try before asking for help or doubting yourself.
