## Essay

## 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

I was born and grow in Shanghai, China. I immigrated to the States five years ago, at my thirties. When I was in China, the ability of English is my advantage. After I moved here, it turns out to be a weakness. Therefore, I am looking for a real “solid” skill to fulfill myself, which is internationally accepted. 

Objectively speaking, I think programming is a lifetime skillset, even though programming is keeping updating and developing. Another reason is the programming industry is booming and software engineers are always in huge demands. I have been living in Seattle for five years, and can feel the vitality of this city in the Technology industry.

Personally speaking, I am interested in Ada Developers Academy since Ada opens a door to me. I admire Ada’s vision and contributions to our community. I am interested in programming since it is detail-orientated and with innovation, passion and enthusiasm. Engineers need basic rules to generate codes, and need creative thoughts at the meantime. I took accounting classes in Bellevue College for the bookkeeping certificate. The part I don’t like about accounting is that everything is following the regulation. As an accountant, no one can be creative.

During my working experience, I worked with engineering team in game companies. As a team player, I get well along with engineers. One point I want to mention is that all those engineers are male. Before the popularity of web and mobile games, engineers working on the big console games are proud of using C++, C# for coding, which are treated as high-end code language. While web games need Flash and AS3 to code. I met so many senior engineers not willing to make adjustments. Personally, I am working on the Ada jumpstart classes on the Github right now. I know different code languages such as C+, Java, Html, and Juby. Some languages can work together for the better results. We create code in a text editor, which is also a computer program. I need more time and a chance to working on the codes formally and I believe that I can do great in the near future.

## 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

_First 2 years_ I will take a full time job as a junior soft-engineer. Tech companies such as Mircosoft, Google, Amazon, other companies such as Costco and Starbucks and small companies are all needs engineers for web developing and maintenance or any other jobs I can do. I prefer game company.

_Second 3-4 years_ I am supposed to get promoted since during the past two years, I am keeping learning and practice coding. Therefore, the aim of the second two-year-period is to be a senior soft-engineer. For this period, I would look for chance to go back to the game developing company if I wasn’t. I would like to contribute more time and energy to game developing. At the meantime, I start to learn some other code language such as Unity.  

_Last on the fifth year_ I should working on developing the second game. It might be a VR game on the mobile platform, since I think VR has so much potential in the near future. My updating coding language Unity skill will support the game developing.


## 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?
After reading Ada’s statements, I want to talk about the culture conflicts first. As I said before, before moving in the states, I was living in Shanghai, China. Even, Shanghai is a big and international city, but people there are sort of traditional and consertive. I was shocked when people here were talking about the trans-gender students should or should not use the male or female bathroom since people in China are still working on providing free lunch for students in provitiy. Living in the community in this era, it changes and more people with different culture backgrounds are emmgered together. Everyone has choices to have the life they prefer. What we should do is to respect their choices. 
And if I accepted by Ada and be a qualified engineer later, I would contribute more to Ada. I would like to support Ada with financial support and make my own contribution. I would like to provide more chances for those women who are just me right now need a chance to change. 

## 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

In 2012, I was having my first kid. Like other new moms, I was worried and nerves, so when my mom and my mother-laws offered helps. I think it would be great if they were helping me at the same time right after my delivery time, which turns to be a big mistake. 
Both moms are bossy, they think the way they use are the best. It is like running a project, I should not put two leaders in the same team. In a team, even teammembers should cooperate and team-working. But we need a final leader to make the final decision. 
Also, it is a wasting of human resource. If a job can be down by one person, do not rely on two. With one person, it is more ownership. What we should do is to shift the labor and maximize their productivity. 
Negotiation doesn’t work on peoples not capable of thinking calmly and objectively.
