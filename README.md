## Essay

## 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

I was born and grow in Shanghai, China. I immigrated to the States five years ago, at my thirties.  Living in a country speaking Mandarin, the ability of English is my advantage, while here in the States, it turns out to be a weakness. Therefore, I am eager to find a real “solid” skill to fulfill myself.

Objectively speaking, I think programming is a lifetime skillset, even though programming is keeping updating and developing. The programming industry is booming and software engineers are always in huge demands. 

Personally speaking, I like programming since it is a career with details, rules, innovation, passion and enthusiasm. Engineers need basic rules to generate codes, and need creative thoughts at the meantime. I took accounting classes in Bellevue College for the bookkeeping certificate. The part I don’t like about accounting is that everything is following the regulation. I cannot be creative as an accountant. 

During my working experience, I worked with engineering team. As a team player, I get well along together.  For myself, I am just working on the Ada jumpstart classes on the Github. The codes look mystery so far and I believe that I can do much better in the near future. 


## 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?
After graduated from the Ada, I am a qualified soft-engineer. I can see software engineering jobs everywhere in various companies. The big Tech companies, such as Mircosoft, Google, Amazon, are always in a huge demand of engineers. As the development of Internet and online-shopping, companies such as Costco, Starbucks also need soft-engineers for website maintenance or apps developments. Also, small startup no matter what kind of type is always eager for engineers. I can see myself as a junior soft engineer in those industries for no more than 2 years. I will enrich myself through the working experience and I believe I will success. I will specialize in one area of the engineering and be a master of it. Later on, I will be a senior engineer in that area such as web engineering. 
Since the tech industry changes fast, we should keep our pace on it. Take the game industry as an example. At the beginning time, players like console games which needs XXX engineers. Later on, more causal games like web games are popular. Enginners used to write XXX code now needs to switch to XXX code. Nowadays, plays spend more time on mobile games, pushing more engineers learning Android and IOS software. Therefore, we should be prepared to change. 

## 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?
After reading Ada’s statements, I want to talk about the culture conflicts first. As I said before, before moving in the states, I was living in Shanghai, China. Even, Shanghai is a big and international city, but people there are sort of traditional and consertive. I was shocked when people here were talking about the trans-gender students should or should not use the male or female bathroom since people in China are still working on providing free lunch for students in provitiy. Living in the community in this era, it changes and more people with different culture backgrounds are emmgered together. Everyone has choices to have the life they prefer. What we should do is to respect their choices. 
And if I accepted by Ada and be a qualified engineer later, I would contribute more to Ada. I would like to support Ada with financial support and make my own contribution. I would like to provide more chances for those women who are just me right now need a chance to change. 

## 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

In 2012, I was having my first kid. Like other new moms, I was worried and nerves, so when my mom and my mother-laws offered helps. I think it would be great if they were helping me at the same time right after my delivery time, which turns to be a big mistake. 
Both moms are bossy, they think the way they use are the best. It is like running a project, I should not put two leaders in the same team. In a team, even teammembers should cooperate and team-working. But we need a final leader to make the final decision. 
Also, it is a wasting of human resource. If a job can be down by one person, do not rely on two. With one person, it is more ownership. What we should do is to shift the labor and maximize their productivity. 
Negotiation doesn’t work on peoples not capable of thinking calmly and objectively.
